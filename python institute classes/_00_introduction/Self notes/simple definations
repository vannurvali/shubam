Python:
-------
    Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems
    more efficiently.

Variable is a name which is used to refer memory location of value.

Variables ?
Variables are containers for storing data values.

Casting ?
If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

Variable Names ?
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)


Unpack a Collection ?
If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. Python allows you to extract the values into variables.
 This is called unpacking.

Global Variables ?
Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples above) are known as global variables.
Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.

Python Collections (Arrays) ?
---------------------------
There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.

 Arithmetic operators

Relational(Comparison) Operators:
These operators compare the values on either sides of them and decide the relation among them. They are also called Relational operators

 Bitwise Operators :
Bitwise operator works on bits and performs bit by bit operation.

Membership Operators :
Pythonâ€™s membership operators test for membership in a sequence, such as

Identity Operators :
Identity operators compare the memory locations of two object


Python Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:
Operator	Example	Same As
=	x = 5	x = 5
+=	x += 3	x = x + 3
-=	x -= 3	x = x - 3
*=	x *= 3	x = x * 3
/=	x /= 3	x = x / 3
%=	x %= 3	x = x % 3
//=	x //= 3	x = x // 3
**=	x **= 3	x = x ** 3
&=	x &= 3	x = x & 3
|=	x |= 3	x = x | 3
^=	x ^= 3	x = x ^ 3
>>=	x >>= 3	x = x >> 3
<<=	x <<= 3	x = x << 3

Python Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

Operator	Name	             Example
==	Equal	                     x == y
!=	Not equal	                 x != y
>	Greater than	             x > y
<	Less than	                 x < y
>=	Greater than or equal to    x >= y
<=	Less than or equal to	     x <= y



loops
-----
The while Loop ?
With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

The break Statement ?
With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:

The continue Statement ?
With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next:

The else Statement ?
With the else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true:

python Loops
-----------------------

The looping simplifies the complex problems into the easy ones.
It enables us to alter the flow of the program so that instead of
writing the same code again and again, we can repeat the same code
for a finite number of times.


Python for loop
----------------
The for loop in Python is used to iterate the statements or a part of the program several times.
The for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, string) or other iterable objects.
Iterating over a sequence is called traversal.

The for loop is used in the case where we need to execute some part of the code
until the given condition is satisfied.
It is better to use for loop if the number of iteration is known in advance.

while loop
----------
The while loop in Python is used to iterate over a block of code as long as
the test expression (condition) is true.
We generally use this loop when we don't know the number of times to iterate in advance

The while loop is to be used in the scenario where we don't know the number of iterations in advance.
The block of statements is executed in the while loop until the condition specified in the while loop is satisfied.
It is also called a pre-tested loop.


range in python
---------------
It returns a sequence of numbers starting from zero and increment by 1 by default and stops before the given number.
 Now that we know the definition of range, let's see the syntax: range(start, stop, step)
